Python program that allows users to search for Indian postal codes and retrieve information about the corresponding post offices. It first checks whether the computer is connected to the internet and then prompts the user to select between two options: searching for postal code data using a PIN code or a post office branch name.

If the user selects the PIN code option, they will be prompted to enter a PIN code, which will be used to make an API request to retrieve the corresponding post office data. If the user selects the post office branch name option, they will be prompted to enter a post office branch name, which will be used to make an API request to retrieve the corresponding post office data.

The program will then retrieve and display the relevant information in a pandas dataframe. The user has the option to save the data to their local machine as a CSV file.
